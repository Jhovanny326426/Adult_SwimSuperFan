MyFirst Front-End Website
This is my first front-end website project. I built it to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while learning how to make a website both functional and visually appealing. I also documented my design process and did UX testing to see what worked well and what could be improved.

Project Overview
The website is simple but interactive and responsive. Key features include:
A clean and modern design that works on both desktop and mobile
Interactive elements using JavaScript
A PDF showing my design process, iterations, and UX testing

My Design Process
I included a PDF called UX_testing_and_iterations.pdf that shows:

Initial sketches and wireframes

Design changes based on feedback

Results from usability testing

Final decisions and why I made them

How to View the Website
